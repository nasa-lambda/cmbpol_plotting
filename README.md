# Tools for plotting CMB polarization power spectra.

This repository contains IDL routines and data files for plotting observed
B-mode power from CMB experiments with significant detections, and upper limits
for B-mode power from other CMB experiments. Theoretical BB power spectra for a
LCDM model are also plotted. The plots that are produced are similar to those
on the LAMBDA graphics page, http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/graphics/. Comments in
the IDL routines give further information. The IDL routines call readcol.pro
and associated routines from the IDL Astronomy User's Library,
http://idlastro.gsfc.nasa.gov/. The routines and data files will be updated as
new results become available.
